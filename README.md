This segment equips participants with essential skills for designing and refining antennas suitable for satellite communication applications.

The culmination of the course involves the deployment of a TinyGS ground station. Participants apply their acquired knowledge to set up and configure ground stations using ESP32 platforms, establishing bidirectional communication with CubeSats or other satellites. Through collaborative project work, they demonstrate proficiency in satellite communication systems, antenna deployment, and operational management of ground stations, preparing them for real-world applications in the burgeoning field of CubeSats and satellite communication technologies.

# What are CubeSats?
CubeSats are a class of nanosatellites that use a standard size and form factor.  The standard CubeSat size uses a ‚Äúone unit‚Äù or ‚Äú1U‚Äù measuring 10x10x10 cms and is extendable to larger sizes; 1.5, 2, 3, 6, and even 12U. Originally developed in 1999 by California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly) and Stanford University to provide a platform for education and space exploration.  The development of CubeSats has advanced into its own industry with government, industry and academia collaborating for ever increasing capabilities.  CubeSats now provide a cost effective platform for science investigations, new technology demonstrations and advanced mission concepts using constellations, swarms disaggregated systems.

</ul>

## Historyüìñ
The CubeSat concept originated in the late 1990s as a collaborative effort between Stanford University's Space Systems Development Laboratory (SSDL) and California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly). Professors Bob Twiggs (Stanford) and Jordi Puig-Suari (Cal Poly) proposed the idea of a standardized, small satellite format to enable affordable space access for universities and other entities.

## CubeSat dispenser system
![nasa_iss_on_orbit_status_report_image_030617_945](https://github.com/DonaldB2003/SI-2024-CubeSat-SU/assets/173866002/45e17908-a8a4-44ae-afc5-d33e8230039e)

A CubeSat dispenser system is a critical component used to deploy CubeSats into orbit from a host satellite or launch vehicle. These systems are designed to securely hold CubeSats of various sizes, conforming to standard dimensions like 1U, 2U, or 3U, and ensure their safe release once the host satellite reaches its designated orbit. Integrated into the payload configuration of the launch vehicle, CubeSat dispensers typically employ mechanisms such as springs, pneumatic actuators, or mechanical latches to eject CubeSats at specified velocities and orientations. This controlled deployment process not only facilitates efficient utilization of launch vehicle payload capacity but also enables multiple CubeSats to be deployed in sequence, supporting diverse mission objectives including scientific research, Earth observation, technology demonstration, and educational initiatives. By simplifying and standardizing the deployment process, CubeSat dispenser systems contribute significantly to the accessibility and cost-effectiveness of space missions involving CubeSats.

## Development Process Overview üìä

The overall timeframe can vary depending on the launch vehicles selected and what you are trying to accomplish with your CubeSat.
A CubeSat can be designed,bulit,tested and delivered in as little as 6 months,but it takes typically,18 to 24 months to complete. Once your CubeSat is delivered,the typical time to launch is anywhere from few months to few years.This is obviously affected by the availability of launch oppurtunities,but also by the feasibilty of your orbital requirements-the more flexible,the easier to manifest,and therefore the shorter wait.
Launch vehicles will usually require you to deliver your finished CubeSat between 4 to 6 months,prior to launch.
The project phases are as follows:
-  Concept Development(1-6 Months)
-  Securing Fundings (1-12 Months)

## Block Diagram For communication

![communication](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0ed18d1-cb8b-40e6-948e-94b4ebe79033)


## SPI Protocolüé©

**SPI** (Serial Peripheral Interface) is a synchronous serial communication protocol used for short-distance communication primarily between microcontrollers, sensors, and peripheral devices. Here are some key points about SPI:


**Basic Operation:** SPI operates in full-duplex mode, meaning data can be sent and received simultaneously. It uses four lines:

  -  SCLK (Serial Clock): Clock signal generated by the master device.
  -  MOSI (Master Out Slave In): Master sends data to slave.
  -  MISO (Master In Slave Out): Slave sends data to master.
  -  SS/CS (Slave Select/Chip Select): Used by the master to select which slave device to communicate with.
    
  
**Master-Slave Relationship:** In SPI communication, there is typically one master device that controls the communication and one or more slave devices that respond to the master.
  
**Clock and Data Transmission:** Data is transmitted in synchronized fashion with the clock. Each clock pulse (rising edge or falling edge, depending on configuration) typically corresponds to one bit of data being transmitted.

**Data Transfer Modes:** SPI can operate in different modes (0 through 3), which determine the polarity and phase of the clock signal. The modes are defined by:

**Clock Polarity (CPOL):** Determines the idle state of the clock (high or low).

**Clock Phase (CPHA):** Determines whether data is sampled on the leading or trailing edge of the clock pulse.

![phpcyBPrf](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2cd8e3ca-968f-4e12-8fae-2cf9d917a402)

**Advantages:**

- High speed: SPI can achieve high data transfer rates compared to other serial communication protocols.
- Simple hardware implementation: Requires minimal pins for communication.
- Full-duplex communication: Allows simultaneous data transmission and reception.
- Applications: SPI is commonly used in embedded systems, IoT devices, sensors, memory devices (like EEPROMs), ADCs (Analog-to-Digital Converters), DACs (Digital-to-Analog Converters), and many other peripherals where fast and reliable 
 serial communication is needed.

*SPI is a versatile and widely used protocol due to its simplicity, speed, and flexibility in connecting multiple devices. However, it is designed for communication over short distances within a single PCB or between closely located devices due to the lack of inherent noise immunity and clock synchronization mechanisms over longer distances.*

# Electromagnetic Spectrum

The electromagnetic spectrum refers to the entire range of wavelengths or frequencies of electromagnetic radiation, which includes all types of light. This spectrum ranges from very low-frequency radio waves to very high-frequency gamma rays. Here are the key segments of the electromagnetic spectrum, ordered from longest to shortest wavelengths (or lowest to highest frequencies):

![radio-frequency-bands](https://github.com/DonaldB2003/SI-2024-CubeSat-SU/assets/173866002/ac2d60d7-b8f9-4115-b2af-bab1424c9d72)




## EM Waves

![istockphoto-1194626452-612x612](https://github.com/DonaldB2003/SI-2024-CubeSat-SU/assets/173866002/5ed674c5-9d36-4051-8763-5a913fdb5083)

ŒΩ = c/Œª
<ul>
  ŒΩ = 433MHz
  <li>Œª=c/ŒΩ</li>
  <li>Œª=0.692m</li>
</ul>


### VHF (Very High Frequency):
Refers to radio frequencies ranging from 30 MHz to 300 MHz. VHF frequencies are commonly used for FM radio broadcasting, television broadcasting (channels 2-13), maritime communication, air traffic control, and some military and government communication.

### UHF (Ultra High Frequency):
Refers to radio frequencies ranging from 300 MHz to 3 GHz. UHF frequencies are used for a variety of purposes including television broadcasting (channels 14-83 and above), satellite communication, cell phones, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and many two-way radios (walkie-talkies).


# Atmospheric attenuation

"Atmospheric attenuation refers to the reduction in electromagnetic radiation intensity as it travels through Earth's atmosphere. This occurs due to absorption, scattering (like Rayleigh and Mie scattering), and reflection by gases, aerosols, and water vapor. It affects various applications such as satellite communication, weather forecasting, and remote sensing, influencing the choice of frequencies used in these technologies."

# OrbitsüöÄ

## 4 Types of Orbit

There are several types of orbits that objects can follow around celestial bodies such as planets or stars.

![image](https://github.com/DonaldB2003/SI-2024-CubeSat-SU/assets/173866002/58fa41f0-29e9-4ad9-97f9-1c96d9a23d9c)

### Here are four common types of orbits:

-  **Low Earth Orbit (LEO):**
Orbits at altitudes typically between 160 kilometers (100 miles) and 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) above the Earth's surface. LEO is used by many satellites for Earth observation, communication, and scientific research.

-  **Geostationary Orbit (GEO):**
Orbits at an altitude of approximately 35,786 kilometers (22,236 miles) above the equator. Satellites in GEO orbits remain fixed relative to a point on Earth's surface, making them ideal for communication and weather satellites.

-  **Polar Orbit:**
Passes over Earth's poles, allowing satellites to observe the entire surface of the Earth over time as the planet rotates beneath the orbit. Polar orbits are used for Earth observation, mapping, and scientific research.

-  **Heliocentric Orbit:**
Orbits around the Sun rather than a planet. Planets, comets, and asteroids follow heliocentric orbits within our solar system. Spacecraft such as those sent to explore other planets or to study the Sun also follow heliocentric orbits.

"These different orbits serve various purposes depending on the mission objectives, including communication, Earth observation, scientific exploration, and more"

# Antenna

Antennas are devices used to transmit and receive electromagnetic waves, typically in the radio frequency (RF) range. They come in various types, each designed for specific applications based on factors like frequency range, directivity, and physical size

## Radiation
![OIP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2609d44a-ab6f-49f1-b424-11b3af1949d1)

Radiation refers to energy that travels through space in the form of waves or particles. It can be categorized into ionizing radiation (such as X-rays and gamma rays) and non-ionizing radiation (like radio waves and visible light). Ionizing radiation has enough energy to remove tightly bound electrons from atoms, potentially causing damage to living tissues and DNA. Understanding and managing exposure to radiation is crucial in fields such as medicine, energy production, and space exploration.

## Mechanism Of Radiation

-  If a charge is not moving, current is not created and there is no radiation.
-  If charge is moving with a uniform velocity:
-  There is no radiation if the wire is straight, and infinite in extent.
-  There is radiation if the wire is curved, bent, discontinuous, terminated, or truncated.
-  If charge is oscillating in a time-motion, it radiates. even if the wira is straight.

## Lab 5: Printing data in the serial monitor

-**Serial Monitor** is an essential tool when creating projects with Arduino. It can be used as a debugging tool, testing concepts, or communicating directly with the Arduino board.

-The **Arduino IDE 2** has the Serial Monitor tool integrated with the editor, which means that no external window is opened when using the Serial Monitor. This means that you can have multiple windows open, each with its own Serial Monitor.
```c
#include <Arduino.h>

void setup() {
  // Initialize Serial Monitor
  Serial.begin(115200);
}

void loop() {
  // Print "Hello" to Serial Monitor
  Serial.println("Hello");

  // Delay for 1 second (1000 milliseconds)
  delay(1000);
}

```


## Lab 6: Controlling an LED through serial monitor

Controlling an LED connected to ESP32 by reading commands from the serial monitor and turning the LED on or off based on those commands.

```c
//ESP32 TO serial monitor
#define LED 2

void setup(){
  Serial.begin(9600);
pinMode(LED, OUTPUT);
}

void loop(){
  if(Serial.available()){
    String command = Serial.readStringUntil('\n');
    
    if(command == "ON"){
      digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
      Serial.println("Turn LED ON ");
    }
    else if (command == "OFF"){
      digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
      Serial.println("Turn LED OFF");

    }

Plot it with proper annonation and axis labeling.
Compute the FFT of the above signal and plot it.
You will notice the FFT resolution is very limited for a single cycle.
Create another a signal of frequency 3MHz, add it to above signal and do FFT for the resultant signal.
Simulate lab2-fsk.py and anlayze the plot to understand FSK modulation.
Change the code such that the modulation frequency for 1 is 4MHz and for 0 it is 3MHz.
Change the above code to simulate ASK modulation.
Add demodulation to the above code and plot the time-domain waveform, as well as the FFT of the demodulated signal.
Add a moving average filter to remove the high-frequency component from the demodulated signal.
