Writing code for a CubeSat program involves crafting precise instructions that govern its operations in space. Engineers focus on developing efficient algorithms that manage onboard systems like attitude control and scientific data acquisition. Integration of sensors and implementation of robust communication protocols ensure seamless interaction with ground stations for data transmission. Safety and autonomy are paramount, with algorithms designed to autonomously respond to contingencies. Extensive testing under simulated and real space conditions validates the reliability and functionality of the code. Documentation plays a crucial role in maintaining and updating the software, ensuring smooth operation throughout the mission
